Dr. Marcinko is a Behavioural Scientist and Assistant Professor in the Psychology Department at Durham University. His research spans several topics in social/organisational psychology and behavioural science.

Most recently, his work has focused on understanding how individuals react when businesses and institutions act hypocritically — that is, when their actions don’t match their stated values or beliefs. He also has ongoing projects focused on mental health issues among leaders, diversity and inclusion programmes, and encouraging prosocial behaviour.

In his consulting work, Andrew’s been involved in projects for the United Nations, NASA, and the US Navy Submarine School and has worked with several Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 companies to help them develop more effective diversity and inclusion programmes.
